# TCMID-face-image-dataset
In addition to a high performance network, a good dataset with high-quality and well labeled images is also a crucial component. In some sense, one of the hardest problems to solve in deep learning has nothing to do with neural nets: it's the problem of getting the right data in the right format. The lack of accurate annotated datasets becomes a major obstacle in the progress of face parsing for TCMI. To bridge this gap, we construct a face parsing dataset named TCMID, which contains 1,500 face images and their corresponding 6-category pixel-level label maps.
